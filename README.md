This is my personal blog: https://www.expunctis.com/

This website was originally created using the [Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) which I gradually modified as I was learning web design.

The js code for displaying and resizing expanded images (`ex-punctis.github.io/_includes/img-zoom.js`) was written by me. I've tested it on iOS 10 devices and in Safari 11.1.2, Chrome 67.0.3396.99 and Firefox 61.0.1. Feel free to re-use this code (although you likely would be better off with a proper lightbox-like library). Check `ex-punctis.github.io/_includes/` for image wrappers (`one-med-image.html`, `one-small-image.html`, `two-small-images.html`) and `https://github.com/ex-punctis/ex-punctis.github.io/blob/master/_sass/jekyll-theme-cayman-custom.scss` for the relevant CSS classes. You might find certain parts of this script "idiosyncratic" â€” it's because svg files generated by ggsave gave me a lot of trouble when I tried to constrain both their width and height using standard methods.
