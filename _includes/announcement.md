**Announcement**: 
<span class="post-index" style="font-weight: lighter; color:#333333;">I am looking for a data analyst/ data scientist position in Canada or the US (TN visa). Most of my projects are related to data analysis; however, I am also familiar with statistics and machine learning techniques/tools, which in combination with my R&D and consulting experience in the chemical industry would be very useful to companies interested in implementing data science methods or offering AI products (e.g. for process control) in this industry. If you have any tips or questions, please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perederiy/) or via reddit (username: got_data). <a href="{{ site.url }}/resume_perederiy.pdf">Resume link</a></span><br>
